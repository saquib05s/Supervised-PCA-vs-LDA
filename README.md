# Supervised-PCA-vs-LDA
Analytical comparison of the mentioned two methods of reducing dimensionality of data (here images) using simple Deep Neural Network (DNN). This is one of the biggest issues when dealing with high-dimensionality data. The data is taken from Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset.
